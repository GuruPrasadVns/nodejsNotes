Promises
#############################################################################################################
A Promise is an object which holds the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When an asynchronous operation completes its either results to a value or an error. A promise basically
promises you that it will give you the result of an asynchronous operation.

A Promise object can have either of these three states
  - Pending
  - Fulfilled
  - Rejected

When the Promise object is created it is in the Pending state. In this state it is about to kick off any async
operation. When an async operation completes successfully it is in Fullfilled state or if some error occurs
in the execution of the async operation it is in Rejected state.
